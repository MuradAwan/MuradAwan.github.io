'The Colosseum', written by Murad Awan

The largest amphitheater in Rome, the Colosseum was built as Emperor Vespasian's gift to the public. Unlike most amphitheaters, which were partly dug into the hillside, the Colosseum was made entirely of stone and concrete. 

It had over 50,000 seats, arranged to represent societal stratification: the top tier of seats was reserved for the Emperor. Beneath him sat the upper-class, followed by the tier of ordinary citizens, and finally, the tier for women and the poor. A retractable awning served as an umbrella to shield the spectators from the sun.

The Colosseum opened with a festival of 100 days of games, including chariot racing, mock naval battles, and its iconic gladiatorial battles. Most of these games involved gratuitous violence in-line with the militaristic culture of Rome. Indeed, the Romans went to great lengths to glorify battle and vilify defeated soldiers; a common tradition on weddings was to use a spear dipped in the body of a defeated and killed gladiator to part the hair of a bride.

Despite the reverence Romans showed towards victorious gladiators, most of the fighters in the Colosseum were actually prisoners or slaves, with a few exceptions: sometimes, bystanders and spectators were forced into the arena. For instance, when Emperor Claudius disliked the stage machinery, he had the mechanics responsible for it battle in the arena. 

Nevertheless, even emperors would sometimes participate in the games. Emperor Commodus was famous for his fondness of joining an assortment of competitions, including the gladiatorial arena, and claimed to be the victor of a thousand matches.
After centuries of use, however, the Colosseum was left to deteriorate. The damage it incurred from natural causes was left without repair, and eventually, chunks of the amphitheater were broken down to be used as building material elsewhere.
