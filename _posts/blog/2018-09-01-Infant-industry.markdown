Infant-industry and its viability in the present world, written by Murad Awan

#### Introduction:

Infant-industry protection refers to the idea that fledgling domestic industries need help in gaining their footing because competing with established foreign industries is otherwise frequently futile.

Consider, for instance, technology and economies of scale: a firm entering the market has to invest an intimidating sum of money in bringing its products on par with the quality of established competition. To worsen matters, economies of scale prevents domestic newcomers from making and selling products as cheaply as the foreign competition that cuts costs through years of incremental improvements to their production line.

Infant-industry protection is often suggested as a means to resolve this conundrum by giving new industries a fighting chance in the market.

This paper offers a brief overview of the case for and against infant-industry protection, concluding with my thoughts on its viability in today’s world.

#### The Case Against:

Many are quick to point out the near-ubiquitous belief in Economics of state intervention decreasing efficiency. As Salamat Ali points out in his paper, tariffs and quotas causes deadweight losses, decreasing domestic consumption and increasing local prices, without a guarantee of improvement in the domestic industry as it can abuse the intervention by keeping out foreign competition without itself contributing to the economy. 

An extension of this rent-seeking problem is that infant-industry industry protection can actually prevent an industry from growing: firms often deliberately stay in their “infant” state indefinitely to continue receiving benefits. As a result, instead of growing up healthy, the industry turns akin to a leech sucking the life-force from the rest of the economy.

Arguments against protectionism accept that removing it kills some domestic industries; however, they point out, the domestic industry only falls where it lacks a comparative advantage, and its labor eventually relocates to sectors where the country has a comparative advantage. Thus, the reasoning goes, the good outweighs the bad and eventually, liberalization results in a net gain.

#### The Case For:

In favor of protectionism, The Guardian points to Dani Rodrik's observation of policies geared towards domestic needs resulting in a more positive impact than catering to a foreign market. For instance, Vietnam is more protectionist than Mexico but still enjoys a significantly better economy. Similarly, South Korea's economy would be far weaker had it forsaken protectionist measures in the past.

As such, historical examples directly contradict the notion of state intervention being poor in the long-term. In the aforementioned cases, infant-industry protection was precisely what boosted the long-term economies of Vietnam and South Korea by allowing their industries a safe space to initially grow, and eventually flourish, in.

#### What to do, what to do!

I believe that despite its potential faults, infant-industry protection has an important place in today's economy.

First of all, I feel Ali’s paper ignores an important aspect: greater production. Helping new industries gain footing creates jobs and increases overall production. Yes, the state intervention reduces efficiency, and hence the “slice of pie” that the economy receives reduces in proportion; however, the higher overall production increases the size of the pie itself, thus allowing the economy a larger slice despite the smaller proportion. We see this in the aforementioned example of South Korea, where infant-industry protectionism resulted in an overall net gain despite the inefficiencies it introduced.

The issue of rent-seeking and infant-industries halting in growth is a strong argument, but should be reason to strengthen protectionism through incentives instead of giving it up altogether. For example, instead of offering support only to industries below a fixed threshold in production, the offered support can be tied to time itself. The state can announce a plan to protect the industry it wants to grow for the first X years, with quotas and tariffs relaxed incrementally each afterwards.

In this way, new industries receive an opportunity to start up while still maintaining an incentive to grow to match foreign competition.

Lastly, at the risk of moving to a more philosophical, rather than economics, argument, I will argue that the short-term has value too. Even if the infant-industry protection harms in the long-term, its short-term benefits can be worthwhile. After all, even if liberalization of trade eventually moves labor to a more profitable industry, the short-term destruction of livelihoods can turn devastating. Indeed, I assign more value to the people in the present than in the future because we can more or less ensure the livelihoods of those in the present through protectionism but we cannot predict future events which may prevent the workforce from gaining the skills and education necessary for relocating to other sectors. As such, giving up protectionism becomes a case of “giving up a bird in hand for two in the bush.”

As such, I conclude that infant-industry protection, accompanied with balanced incentives, is not just viable, but very much a necessary tool for many developing countries to boost their economies.
